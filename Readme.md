### How to read data from .csv
col 1: 0 -> before, 1 -> at, 2 -> after  
col 2: frame pause in mili sec  
col 3: sound nr  
col 4: 1 -> Horizontal, 2 -> Cross, 3 -> Pendulum  
col 5: 0 -> no bounce, -> 1 bounce   
col 6: 11 -> frame stop test, 22 -> different sound test, 33 -> different trajectories test  
double 00 means it doesn't change durring the test, check in unity.
